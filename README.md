Aim: map out the connections among philosophers/scientists throughout history according to data available on wikipedia. Map should show relations of influence across time and geographic region.

Done so far: built a few scrapers (with the help of Cheerio) that collect biographical data for philosophers/scientists (so far 1,500 listed items)

To do: data analysis and D3, tests, and documentation
